//! Events: everything the simulation emits when it advances.
//!
//! Each call to [`crate::world::World::step`] returns the events produced that
//! tick. Events are the unit the per-player view filter delays and fogs (M3),
//! and the unit the persistence layer appends to its event log (§14). For M1
//! the only events are session-level (a corporation appearing).
//!
//! Every event carries the simulation time at which it occurred so the view
//! filter can later decide when each player's light has reached it.
